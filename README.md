# My Games
## A Quick Test App for Ember / Rails

This is really just a simple application for testing out the current build of the Ember.js framework ( 0.9.4 ). What I intend to do is a create a view with a list of games that should update dynamically when a seperate client connects and makes a change.

Questions on how this turns out? Ask me at [rjfranco@gmail.com](mailto:rjfranco@gmail.com)
